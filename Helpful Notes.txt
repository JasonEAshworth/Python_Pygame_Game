If you're moving a sprite around the screen, add it to a pygame.sprite.RenderUpdates 
group, use the Group.draw function to draw the sprite, and when you need to move it,
use the Group.clear function to draw a background over the sprite.  So, briefly, the
steps involved are this:
1.) Blit your background onto a surface
2.) Make your sprite
3.) Add your sprite to a RenderUpdates sprite group
4.) Use Group.draw to draw your sprite to your active surface
5.) When updating, use Group.clear with your active surface as the target, and
the previously made background surface as your background.
6.) Update your sprite location information
7.) Use Group.draw to redraw the sprite at the new location on your active surface.

The final result will be that you only update the portion of your screen that needs
to be updated, often resulting in greatly increased performance.
